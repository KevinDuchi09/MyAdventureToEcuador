		<h1>Guayaquil</h1>

		<p>
			During at Guayaquil I felt like summer again. Temperature reaching up to 85 to 90 degrees. One thing I loved about it here was the beautidul beaches full of relaxation. During the night there are several neighborhoods where the nightlife is the main attraction with plenty of trendy bars, great restaurants, modern music and colorful people to keep it all exciting.
