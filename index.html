			My Adventure to Ecuador
		</h1>

		<p>
			I had a great experience throughout my trip to Ecuador. I enjoyed the environment and the beautiful cultures. My parents were both born in Ecuador. It's a very small country and it's a place known for it's beautiful flowers, culture, history, the Galapagos Island and being home to the equator.
